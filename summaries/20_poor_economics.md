## Poor Economics

### Poverty

In 2005, 865 million people (13 percent of the world’s population) did: 

the fifty countries where most of the poor live is 16 Indian rupees per person per day.2 People who live on less than that are considered to be poor by the government of their own countries. At the current exchange rate, 16 rupees corresponds to 36 U.S. cents. But because prices, they would need to spend more—99 cents. So to imagine the lives of the poor, you have to imagine having to live in Miami or Modesto with 99 cents per day for almost all your everyday needs (excluding housing).
