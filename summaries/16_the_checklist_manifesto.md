### The Checklist Manifesto

* Three reasons for why we fail according to Samuel Gorovitz and Alasdair MacIntyre

    - **necessary fallibility** --- stuff is beyond humanity's comprehension for now.

    - of the stuff *we* know, we fail because of:
        + **ignorance**: practioners don't know
        + **ineptitude**: practioners don't apply what they know correctly
            * Reasons (not via G and M):
                1. The first is the fallibility of human memory and attention, especially when it comes to mundane, routine matters that are easily overlooked under the strain of more pressing events.
                
                2. People may think that steps don't matter---overconfidence, laziness,  etc. --- Line out **minimum neccessary steps**

* Problem Statement How do you make sure that people know and are following the process correctly?

* Solutions:

    - Increase in training requirements but pace of growth of knowledge > sustainable increase in training time.
    - Punish failure
    - Specialization: "There are pediatric anesthesiologists, cardiac anesthesiologists, obstetric anesthesiologists, neurosurgical anesthesiologists ..."
    - Checklists for inteptitude reasons 1 and 2
    - Forcing functions: "A behavior-shaping constraint, also sometimes referred to as a forcing function or poka-yoke, is a technique used in error-tolerant design to prevent the user from making common errors or mistakes. One example is the reverse lockout on the transmission of a moving automobile." Microwave: open door to power off.

### ICU

* Every data in the US, "some ninety thousand people are admitted to intensive care." "Over a year, an estimated five million Americans will be, and over a normal lifetime nearly all of us will come to know the glassed bay of an ICU from"

* "The average stay of an ICU patient is four days, and the survival rate is 86 percent."

* Error Rate:
    - From Israel: "engineers observed patient care in ICUs for twenty-four-hour stretches. They found that the average patient required **178 individual actions per day,** ranging from administering a drug to suctioning the lungs, and every one of them posed risks. Remarkably, the nurses and doctors were observed to make an error in just **1 percent of these actions**—but that still amounted to an **average of two errors a day** with every patient"

    - Half of 150k surgical deaths and 'and major complications' avoidable ("research consistently showed")

* Infection Rates: (Most **avoidable** if you note results from Pronovost)

    - ICUs put five million lines into patients each year, and national statistics show that **after ten days 4 percent of those lines become infected.**
    
    - **Line infections occur in eighty thousand people a year** in the United States and are **fatal between 5 and 28 percent of the time**, depending on how sick one is at the start. Thos who survive, stay an extra 7 days in the ICU.

    - **After ten days with a urinary catheter, 4 percent of American ICU patients develop a bladder infection.**

    - ten days on a ventilator, 6 percent develop bacterial pneumonia, resulting in death 40 to 45 percent of the time.

### Checklists

- History = Model 299 (B-17) considered too complicated but w/ checklist ---works.

- Peter Pronovost/JHU Hospital
    + "Doctors are supposed to (1) wash their hands with soap, (2) clean the patient’s skin with chlorhexidine antiseptic, (3) put sterile drapes over the entire patient, (4) wear a mask, hat, sterile gown, and gloves, and (5) put a sterile dressing over the insertion site once the line is in."
        * **the ten-day line-infection rate went from 11 percent to zero.**

    + Propping up head and antacids: "The proportion of patients not receiving the recommended care dropped from 70 percent to 4 percent, the occurrence of pneumonias fell by a quarter, and twenty-one fewer patients died than in the previous year."
    
    + Michigan: "In the first month, the executives discovered that chlorhexidine soap, shown to reduce line infections, was available in less than a third of the ICUs."

    "Within the first three months of the project, the central line infection rate in Michigan’s ICUs decreased by 66 percent."

    "In the Keystone Initiative’s first eighteen months, the hospitals saved an estimated $175 million in costs and more than fifteen hundred lives."

- Basic Measurements as checklist?
    + "Comprised of four physiological data points—body temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate" (these days pain is the 5th one)

- Learning from Construction (where people must work together):
    - Schedule that lists all tasks that need to be completed every day
    - 

#### Complexity of Medicine (and Construction)

* "Clinicians now have at their disposal some six thousand drugs and four thousand medical and surgical procedures, each with different requirements, risks, and considerations."

* WHO list of total number of diseases, syndromes, types of injury: "more than thirteen thousand"

* Harvard Vanguard: 
    - "Over the course of a year of office practice—which, by definition, excludes the patients seen in the hospital—physicians each evaluated an average of 250 different primary diseases and conditions. Their patients had more than nine hundred other active medical problems that had to be taken into account."
    
    - doctors each prescribed some three hundred medications, ordered more than a hundred different types of laboratory tests, and performed an average of forty different kinds of office procedures—from vaccinations to setting fractures.

* "a third of patients have at least ten specialist physicians actively involved in their care by their last year of life" + PAs + Nurses etc.

* **Construction**
    - on any given day he has between two and five hundred workers on-site, including people from any of sixty subcontractors.
    - 16 different trades

### Magnitude of Medicine

- Americans today undergo an **average of seven operations in their lifetime**, with surgeons performing more than **fifty million operations annually**—the amount of harm remains substantial. We continue to have upwards of **150,000 deaths** following surgery every year—more than three times the number of road traffic fatalities.
