### The Checklist Manifesto

* Three Reasons we fail according to Samuel Gorovitz and Alasdair MacIntyre
    - **necessary fallibility** --- stuff is beyond humanity's comprehension for now.
    - of the stuff *we* know, we fail because of:
        + **ignorance**: practioners don't know
        + **ineptitude**: practioners don't apply what they know correctly

* Solutions:
    - Pace of growth of knowledge > Increase training requirements
    - 

* You see it in the 36 percent increase between 2004 and 2007 in lawsuits against attorneys for legal mistakesâ€”the most common being simple administrative errors, like missed calendar dates and clerical screwups
