## Wiser

**Note:** Though there is some mention of statistical groups, the book is mostly about "deliberating groups." And by deliberating groups, SH mean any group in which people talk. They don't distinguish between a group composed of a boss and underlings, a jury, and a Deliberative Poll (random sample, trained moderators, no pressure of losing yr. job, etc.).

I have extensively reorganized the material to make the logic clearer---the book is woefully disorganized. The new outline = individuals got problems. There are some reasons to think why groups where people talk with each other may do better (worse). What do we find? How do we make groups where people talk better? How do we leverage groups of people more generally?

### Individual Psych. Biases:

* Ignore the long term
* Unduly afraid of losses
* Unrealistic optimism
* Self-serving judgments
* Availability
	- Familiarity
	- Salience (terrorist attack) (Slovic - Perception of risk)
* Representativeness
	- Extent to which A looks like B
	- Looks like a good CEO
* Framing
 	- Save $600 versus lose $600 per year
* Egocentric biases
* Overconfidence
	- Planning Fallacy
	- Optimism
* Hindsight bias
	- I knew it all along
* Sunk cost fallacy
* Anchoring

### Why Deliberating Groups May be Better?

* Information aggregation: even the greatest expert doesn't know everything. Pooling of info.
* Diversity of perspectives can cause people to think carefully, overcome their biases.

### Why Deliberating Groups May be Worse?

* People fail to disclose what they know because of:

  * information signal (similar in spirit to social proof): if most people make the same errors, maybe they are not errors at all. this happens, esp. if the ans. is somewhat debatable.
  	* data: 
  		- evidence that people go with the majority (Thorndike, 1938)
  		- people go with group even when they have reason to believe the answer is false (Huaye Li and Yasuaki  Sakamoto)
  	
  * social pressure: to avoid penalties: disapproval, displeasure from boss, etc.
  
  Conditioning factors:
  	- low status people less likely to speak up

### (Intermediate) Consequences of Failing to Disclose Info.

*  Focus on shared information (stuff most people in the group already know)
    -  don't consider unshared info. enough

* If you are deferring to leader's incorrect opinion or if information signal is problematic, it can amplify errors --- greater belief in incorrect thing.
    - an example of that is happy talk. leaders say everything is great. no one wants to be a bad news bear.
    - example may be Bay of Pigs

### Performance of Deliberating Groups:

* **Baseline:** Deliberating Group should be at least as good as the best member --> group recognizes and defers to the best member

* **Worse**
	- worse in Planning fallacy
	- worse in representativeness (Stasser and Dietz-Uhler)
	- worse in overconfidence (Sniezek and Henry)
	- more vulnerable to framing (Kerr, MacCoun, Kramer)
	- more affected by spurious arguments (Schumann and Thompson)
	- more susceptible to sunk cost fallacy (Whyte - escalating commitment to...)
	- When questions have def. correct answer, do as well as or better than average but not as good as the best (Gigone and Hastie, 1997)

 * **Better**
 	- slightly lower levels of availability (stasson - group consensus processes..)
 	- reduce tendency to anchor on salient numbers
 	- reduce hindsight and egocentric biases

## How to make deliberating groups better?

* Anxious leaders:
	- leaders who ask what could go wrong?
    - otherwise groups can do a bunch of happy talk

* Leaders w/ greater social sensitivity

* Split decision making into 2 stages:
    - creative, divergent thinking stage, e.g. list all possible solutions
    - critical, solution-integration stage, e.g. pick the best solution

### Performance of Statistical Groups

* Hazel Knight: guess temperature (average better than 80% of individuals)
* Beans in a jar (average better than all but 1 individual)
* Galton: weight of an ox (average better than any individual's guess)

### Misc. Info.

Conventional wisdom about groups:
    - Janis Irving - Groupthink -  common in cohesive groups, highly directive leadership, and insulated from experts - turns out he is wrong
