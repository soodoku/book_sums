## Reinventing the Bazaar

### Observations About the Economy

* Even in the most market-oriented economy, a majority of transactions do not actually go through markets.
    - Unpaid work: full-time homemaker in the United States, by one estimate, produces outputs that if priced would be worth about $17,000 per year.
    - gov. work like police + road building --- about a fifth of most modern economies
    - Within firms: more transactions happen within firm that across firms

* **Primitive Markets** 
    * The stallholders are not just retailers but also wholesalers: they buy in bulk to sell small quantities to consumers, and they aggregate small purchases for resale to other sellers. 

    * They organize the transportation of goods—not a simple matter in a country with inadequate roads and railroads—serving as intermediaries between widely scattered producers and consumers. 
    
    * They do some rudimentary manufacturing: crafting with beads and processing raw materials into foodstuffs, condiments, and cosmetics. 
    
    * They find recycling uses for cans, bottles, and newspapers. 
    
    * Assessing their customers’ creditworthiness and granting some of them credit, they take on the role of banks.
    
    * Being illiterate, the stallholders must keep their business records in their heads, using impressive powers of memory. They make precise calculations of their input costs so as to keep track of their profits.

### What is a Market?

A market for something exists if there are people who want to buy it and people who want to sell it.:
    * Decision-making autonomy is key...They are free to make decisions—to buy, to sell, to exert effort, to invest—that reflect their own preferences. 
    * Their choices are not completely free though: they are constrained by the extent of their resources and by the rules of the marketplace.
    * Being able to veto any deal does convey some bargaining power, but not necessarily much.
    * Competition curbs power

### What is Market Design?

Market design consists of the mechanisms that organize buying and selling; channels for the flow of information; state-set laws and regulations that define property rights and sustain contracting; and the market’s culture, its self-regulating norms, codes, and conventions governing behavior.

Transaction Costs

* Comparing alternative sellers and choosing among them takes effort by the buyer. The quality of the goods for sale is often not immediately apparent, and the buyer may have to go to some trouble to evaluate it.
* costs. Monitoring work costs time and money. The enforcement of contracts and the prevention and settling of disputes do
Unemployment exists, for example, not simply because there are too few jobs, but also because transaction costs in the labor market prevent some employers and job seekers from connecting with each other.

#### Top Down or Formal

* government’s role in market design is the defining of property rights.

*  South Africa passed a law in 1997 to make essential medicines affordable by
compulsory licensing

### Markets Are Inescapable

* Rwandans in refugee camps in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), having commercial activity. Some eighty-two thousand businesses mushroomed in the camps by 1995, according to a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
                
* Markets sprang up, similarly, in prisoner-of-war camps during the Second World War. The prisoners traded their Red Cross rations of food, cigarettes, and clothing, according to R. A. Radford,

* Food prices rose whenever a new group of hungry prisoners arrived. In the early days, prices ... food delivery, but later the prisoners began to hold stocks of food, which smoothed

* alcohol consumption end of the Prohibition era, was still about two-thirds its pre-Prohibition level.

### Markets in Everything

* 1500 listed under the heading “Victorian tradecards”—which, it turns out, are a nineteenth-century version of junk mail.

### Market Support

* Entire sectors of a modern economy are devoted to organizing transactions. The retail and wholesale trades and the advertising, insurance, and finance industries exist not to manufacture things but to facilitate transacting. These activities ... accounting in the United States for one-fourth of the gross national product.

### Principles of Market Design

A workable platform has five elements: information flows smoothly; property rights are protected; people can be trusted to live up to their promises; side
effects on third parties are curtailed; and competition is fostered.

### Innovations

* In 1792, one John Sutton, sensing an opportunity, organized a securities exchange at 22 Wall Street, which was then a muddy lane. Sellers would bring in their stocks and bonds each morning, and at noon Sutton would auction them for a commission. then they would hold their own sales, offering the securities at lower commission rates and taking business away from Sutton. This practice soon became self-defeating, as it meant too few securities
To solve this problem, twenty-four of Wall Street’s most prominent brokers agreed to form a new auction. They would trade securities at fixed fees. Membership in the stock exchange was restricted and lucrative, so the brokers were able to regulate themselves on the sanction of Members who defaulted on contracts were barred. Nonmembers who reneged on contracts with members were blacklisted.

*  Dutch Auction: As each lot of flowers is towed by, the clock’s hand starts at a high price and rotates through lower prices until one of the bidders stops it with a push of a button. Computers then automatically organize the flowers’ delivery to the buyer’s address.

* Hambrecht: open IPOs --- even in 2002 people were talking about this
     In a Dutch auction, a company reveals the maximum amount of shares
being sold and sometimes a potential price for those shares. Investors then state the number of shares they want and at what price. Once a minimum clearing price is determined, investors who bid at least that price are awarded shares. If there are more bids than shares available, allotment is on a pro-rata basis--awarding a percent of actual shares available based on the percent bid for--or a maximum basis, which fills the maximum amount of smaller bids by setting an allocation for the largest bids 

### Market Failures

* Of the 33 million people infected worldwide as of 2000, 23 million were in Africa. Every single day, AIDS was killing an average of 5,500 Africans.

* Antiretroviral drugs successfully countered AIDS. U.S. deaths from AIDS fell 70 percent between 1996 and 1998.

* If the key discoveries cited in biomedical patents, just 17% came from industry

* Medicines against tropical diseases make up a minuscule 1 percent of new drug patents.

* In profitability, the pharmaceutical industry ranked comfortably first in the 1999 Fortune 500 list of the top global companies. Its profits were 18 percent of revenues, putting it far ahead of the second-place industry, diversified financial firms, whose profits were 11 percent of revenues;

* The industry’s marketing costs in the United States are estimated to be more than $8,000 per physician.

*  They subject the U.S. government to fierce lobbying, in part to counter accusations of price gouging. During the election campaign of 2000, the pharmaceutical industry’s spending on lobbying, $167 million, exceeded

* via the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal agencies totaled $18 billion in 2000. Universities, foundations, and charities spent another $10 billion or amounts add up to more than the research spending of all the U.S. pharmaceutical companies, which was $22.5 billion.

* Pharma:
    - Consumption of drugs remains flat. 
    - Anti-ulcer: 10% increase in price 7% lower demand

*  There are search costs: the time, effort, and money spent learning what is available where for how much. And there are evaluation costs, arising from the difficulties buyers have in assessing quality.

* repeat business relationships are only a partial solution to informational problems.
