## Reinventing the Bazaar

### Observations About the Economy

* Even in the most market-oriented economy, a majority of transactions do not actually go through markets.
    - **Unpaid work**: full-time homemaker in the United States, by one estimate, produces outputs that if priced would be worth about $17,000 per year.
    - **Gov. work like police + road building** --- about a fifth of most modern economies
    - **Within firms**: more transactions happen within firm that across firms
        - Well over 50% of the GDP is worker comp. in the U.S.

* **"Primitive" Markets**

    * The stallholders are not just retailers but also wholesalers: they buy in bulk to sell small quantities to consumers, and they aggregate small purchases for resale to other sellers. 

    * They organize the transportation of goods—not a simple matter in a country with inadequate roads and railroads—serving as intermediaries between widely scattered producers and consumers. 
    
    * They do some rudimentary manufacturing: crafting with beads and processing raw materials into foodstuffs, condiments, and cosmetics. 
    
    * They find recycling uses for cans, bottles, and newspapers. 
    
    * Assessing their customers’ creditworthiness and granting some of them credit, they take on the role of banks.
    
    * Being illiterate, the stallholders must keep their business records in their heads, using impressive powers of memory. They make precise calculations of their input costs so as to keep track of their profits.

### What is a Market?

A market for something exists if there are people who want to buy it and people who want to sell it.:

    * Decision-making autonomy is key...They are free to make decisions—to buy, to sell, to exert effort, to invest—that reflect their own preferences. 

    * Their choices are not completely free though: they are constrained by the extent of their resources and by the rules of the marketplace.

### Markets Are Inescapable

* Rwandans in refugee camps in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), having commercial activity. Some **eighty-two thousand businesses** mushroomed in the camps by 1995, according to a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
                
* Markets sprang up, similarly, in prisoner-of-war camps during the Second World War. The prisoners traded their Red Cross rations of food, cigarettes, and clothing, according to R. A. Radford.

    * Food prices rose whenever a new group of hungry prisoners arrived. In the early days, prices ... food delivery, but later the prisoners began to hold stocks of food, which smoothed

* **Alcohol consumption end of the Prohibition era was still about two-thirds its pre-Prohibition level.**

### Markets in Everything

* 1500 listings on ebay under the heading “Victorian tradecards”—which, it turns out, are a nineteenth-century version of junk mail.

### Market Design

* Market design consists of the mechanisms that organize buying and selling; channels for the flow of information; state-set laws and regulations that define property rights and sustain contracting; and the market’s culture, its self-regulating norms, codes, and conventions governing behavior.

* A workable platform has five elements: 
    
    * information flows smoothly
    * property rights are protected
    * people can be trusted to live up to their promises
    * side effects on third parties are curtailed
    * competition is fostered.

#### Transaction Costs

* Two types of information costs:
    - search costs: the time, effort, and money spent learning what is available where for how much. . 
    - evaluation costs: 
        - The quality of the goods for sale is often not immediately apparent, and the buyer may have to go to some trouble to evaluate it.
        - Monitoring work costs time and money. 

* price dispersion measured by the difference between the highest and lowest prices charged for a particular item as a percentage of its average price, the typical dispersion, according to one study, was 37 percent for books and 25 percent for compact discs. reasons =
    - shoppers are lazy
    - can't observe quality

* market of lemons:
    
    * Imagine it costs a seller $1.00 to supply a quart of high-quality milk, and $.60 to supply a quart of watered down milk. A typical buyer would willingly pay up to $1.20 for good milk and $.80 for inferior milk. In either case mutual gains could be obtained from trade. If the buyer could recognize the milk’s quality, both buyer and seller would benefit from a sale at a price somewhere between $.60 and $.80 for the low-quality milk and between $1.00 and $1.20 for the high-quality milk. If the buyer is unable to distinguish quality, however, both grades of milk would sell for the same price. Suppose all vendors look alike to our buyer, and he believes that 60 percent of them water down their milk. Then the most he would pay for a quart of milk is $.96, and probably less. (The arithmetic of this is that there is a 40 percent chance the milk is worth $1.20 to the buyer and a 60 percent chance it is worth $.80, so on average it is worth $1.20 0.4 + $.80 0.6, which equals $.96.) But this situation is not sustainable. It costs $1.00 to supply the good milk.

    * Gresham's law --- low-quality drives out high-quality

* search cost and competition. 
    - must buy X
    - cost of prod. = $5
    - your cut-off price = $10. 
    - if 1 seller, you pay $10.
    - if search cost = 0, eval. of quality costs $0, etc., you see bids by several merchants, you pay $5
    - if search cost != 0, price-cutter gets less compensating boost in sales. 
    - math error: if search cost is say .10 per sample and there are 50 sellers and 1 seller is selling at $10. expected return per search = (1/50)*$5 or 10 cents.
    - the price cutter brings the price back up to the extent he doesn't see compensating revenue
    - merchants sell at $15 knowing everyone else is doing the same
    - upshot: small transaction costs can cause big effects

* solutions to search and eval. costs:
    * repeat business relationships
    * brand names---can charge for assurance of quality
    * trademarks 
    * advertising---apparently celebrities cue company's confidence that it will recoup its money 
    * yellow pages
    * consumer reports, etc.
    * real estate agents

* The enforcement of contracts and the prevention and settling of disputes etc.

* Unemployment exists, for example, not simply because there are too few jobs, but also because transaction costs in the labor market prevent some employers and job seekers from connecting with each other.

* Sutton: stock exchange at Wall Street. Earlier stock trading happened haphazardly via word of mouth of newspaper. Sutton created a 'stock exchange'---sellers and buyers would assemble at one place and one time and Sutton would auction off.
    - Sutton charged a commission, which was then undercut as others started holding these markets. 
    - 21 prominent brokers came together to create a new auction. Agreed to transact on fixed fees and only among themselves.
        - setup rules: merchants defaulting on contracts were barred.

#### Competition

* Being able to veto any deal does convey some bargaining power, but not necessarily much. Competition curbs power.

* for effective competition, buyers should be able to easily compare choices

#### Property Rights

* Top Down or Formal

    * Government’s role in market design is the defining of property rights.

    * South Africa passed a law in 1997 to make essential medicines affordable by compulsory licensing

### Trust

* 5th century b.c., Croesus starts issuing gold and silver coins of guaranteed purity

* Moneyback guarantee (likely invented by Potter Palmer, the founder of Marshall Field and Co.)

### Market Support

* Entire sectors of a modern economy are devoted to organizing transactions. The retail and wholesale trades and the advertising, insurance, and finance industries exist not to manufacture things but to facilitate transacting. These activities ... accounting in the United States for one-fourth of the gross national product.

### Political Economy

[Pharma] subject[s] the U.S. government to fierce lobbying, in part to counter accusations of price gouging. During the election campaign of 2000, the pharmaceutical industry’s spending on lobbying, $167 million ...

### Innovations in Markets

* In 1792, one John Sutton, sensing an opportunity, organized a securities exchange at 22 Wall Street, which was then a muddy lane. Sellers would bring in their stocks and bonds each morning, and at noon Sutton would auction them for a commission. then they would hold their own sales, offering the securities at lower commission rates and taking business away from Sutton. This practice soon became self-defeating, as it meant too few securities
To solve this problem, twenty-four of Wall Street’s most prominent brokers agreed to form a new auction. They would trade securities at fixed fees. Membership in the stock exchange was restricted and lucrative, so the brokers were able to regulate themselves on the sanction of Members who defaulted on contracts were barred. Nonmembers who reneged on contracts with members were blacklisted.

*  Dutch Auction: As each lot of flowers is towed by, the clock’s hand starts at a high price and rotates through lower prices until one of the bidders stops it with a push of a button. Computers then automatically organize the flowers’ delivery to the buyer’s address.

* Hambrecht: open IPOs --- even in 2002 people were talking about this
     In a Dutch auction, a company reveals the maximum amount of shares
being sold and sometimes a potential price for those shares. Investors then state the number of shares they want and at what price. Once a minimum clearing price is determined, investors who bid at least that price are awarded shares. If there are more bids than shares available, allotment is on a pro-rata basis--awarding a percent of actual shares available based on the percent bid for--or a maximum basis, which fills the maximum amount of smaller bids by setting an allocation for the largest bids 

### Market Failures

#### Concern

* Of the 33 million people infected worldwide as of 2000, 23 million were in Africa. Every single day, AIDS was killing an average of 5,500 Africans.

* Antiretroviral drugs successfully countered AIDS. U.S. deaths from AIDS fell 70 percent between 1996 and 1998.

* drug to cure sleeping sickness discovered accidentally when looking for an anti-cancer drug. but patent holder didn't care about the market so production ran short till its use discovered in preventing hair from growing.

* Medicines against tropical diseases make up a minuscule 1 percent of new drug patents.

#### Patent Economy

* Anti-ulcer: 10% increase in price 7% lower demand
    - if you have monopoly (patent), you can price much above the prod. cost

#### Profits

* In profitability, the pharmaceutical industry ranked comfortably first in the 1999 Fortune 500 list of the top global companies. Its profits were 18 percent of revenues, putting it far ahead of the second-place industry, diversified financial firms, whose profits were 11 percent of revenues;

#### Research Funding and Innovation

* The industry’s marketing costs in the United States are estimated to be more than $8,000 per physician.
    - pharmacia corp., which makes eye drops for glaucoma, in one year spent 2x the amount of marketing and admin. than research. (total money spent on marketing and admin = 40% of revenue)
    - GSK spent 37% of revenue on marketing and admin. and 14% on research in 2000

* If the key discoveries cited in biomedical patents, just 17% came from industry

* via the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal agencies totaled $18 billion in 2000. Universities, foundations, and charities spent another $10 billion or amounts add up to more than the research spending of all the U.S. pharmaceutical companies, which was $22.5 billion.

* Gov. funded research
    - Of the key discoveries cited in biomedical patents, just 17 percent came from industry, according to a study by the National Science Foundation.
    - green revolution --- research from consortia of governments

### Misc. 

* "God is in the details," declared the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Tradespeople building to architects’ plans would habitually grumble that “the Devil is in the details,” and Mies van der Rohe was inverting their complaint. --- Reinventing the bazaar

* Futures market
    - 1260 in Nagoya, Japan. Futures in rice. Farmers can get paid before harvest.

* In a 1781 letter to his father, Mozart said, doubtless exaggerating somewhat, “Believe me, my sole purpose is to make as much money as possible; for after good health it is the best thing to have.”

* "Buying and selling is therefore a form of creation." --- John McMillan

* People who comparison shop do a favor to everyone else. Sellers more likely to cut costs as they can gain revenue from such people.
