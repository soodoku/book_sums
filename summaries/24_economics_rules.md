## Economics Rules

### Models

1. GS --- Thaler's "Econs" may be from "The Swedish-born economist Axel Leijonhufvud published in 1973 a little article called “Life among the Econ."

2. Model As Fable: As the distinguished economic theorist Ariel Rubinstein puts it, “The word ‘model’ sounds more scientific than ‘fable’ or ‘fairy tale’ [yet] I do not see much difference between them.”
    - Fable: story around a few principal characters, generic place (village, forest), makes little effort to be realistic or to draw a complete picture of the characters, sacrifices realism and ambiguity for clarity of story line. And each fable as a transparent lesson.
    - Nancy Cartwright thinks economic models are more like parables. Unlike fables, where the moral is clear, economic models require lots of care in interpretation. 
    - Fables with contradictory messages everywhere so you need judgment there too.
    - Key argument (which is flawed): key thing we need is judgment about which fable applies the best to the circumstance.

3. Comparison to experiment --- modeler practices a similar method of insulation, isolation, and identification. Creating policy from experiments generally requires some additional evidence, reasoning, etc. 

4. Unrealistic Assumptions May Not Matter if they are not 'critical'

### Value of Math 

1. Math makes clear the assumptions and prevents sloppy reasoning and allows you to work to what can be counterintuitive results. No endless debates about what Keynes, Marx meant. 

2. Math is instrumental --- not needed for models. Schelling was mostly math free.

### Slightly Counterintuitive Results

* 



### (In)Efficient Markets

* Assume that two competing firms must decide whether to have a big advertising budget. Advertising would allow one firm to steal some of the other’s customers. But when they both advertise, the effects on customer demand cancel out. The firms end up having spent money needlessly.

* Ship Builder needs low cost steel. The latter needs first. 'Good' and 'bad' equilibria can happen.

### Misc. 


1. The maverick economist Kenneth Boulding is supposed to have said, “Mathematics brought rigor to economics; unfortunately it also brought mortis.” 

2. The Cambridge University economist Ha-Joon Chang says, “95 percent of economics is common sense—made to look difficult, with the use of jargons and mathematics."
