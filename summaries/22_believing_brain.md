## Believing Brain

### Patternicity

the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless data.

* “On Being Sane in Insane Places,” by Stanford University psychologist David Rosenhan.2 The article, now one of the most famous ever published in the annals of psychology, recounted an experiment by Rosenhan and his associates in which they entered a dozen mental hospitals in five different West coasts, reporting having had a brief auditory hallucination. They stated that the voices were often unclear, but as far as they could tell said something like “empty,” “hollow,” and “thud.” If pressed, they were to interpret the meaning of the voice’s message as “My life is empty and hollow.” All eight were admitted, seven of them diagnosed as schizophrenic and one as manic-depressive. They were, in fact, a psychology grad student, three psychologists, a psychiatrist, a pediatrician, five men), none of whom had any history of mental illness. Outside of the faux auditory hallucination and false names, they were instructed to tell the truth after admission, act normally, and claim that the hallucinations had stopped and that they now felt perfectly fine."

The diagnostic belief bias was pervasive. Because Rosenhan’s charges were bored out of their skulls in these institutions, to pass the time they kept detailed notes of their experiences. In one poignant descriptor, the staff reported that “patient engages in writing behavior”

schedules of reinforcement—for which pecking a key inside a box in which the pigeon was placed would result in delivery of the food through a small food hopper (see figure 1)—the pigeons exhibited an odd assortment of behaviors, such as side-to-side hopping or twirling around counterclockwise before pecking the key.

### Agenticity:

the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning, intention, and agency.

### Impact of belief

* Model-dependent realism “is based on the idea that our brains interpret the input from our sensory organs by making a model of the world.

### Misc.

* Every man is the creature of the age in which he lives; very few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the times.

* “Within the genome, Darwin’s theory predicts that mutations that do not affect function (namely, those located ‘junk DNA’) will accumulate steadily over time,” Collins explains. “Mutations in the coding region of genes, however, are expected to be observed less frequently, since most of these will be deleterious, and only a rare such event will provide a selective advantage and be retained during the evolutionary process. That is exactly what is observed.”
