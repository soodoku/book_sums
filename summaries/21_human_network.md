## Human Network

* How many potential networks with n of 30.
  - total number of potential edges = n choose 2 or 435
  - total = "we note that each possible friendship could either be switched “on” or “off,” and so there are 2 possibilities for each friendship. Thus, the number of possible networks is 2 × 2 × · · · × 2, with 435 entries."
