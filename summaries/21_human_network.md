## Human Network

* How many potential networks with n of 30.
  - total number of potential edges = n choose 2 or 435
  - total = "we note that each possible friendship could either be switched “on” or “off,” and so there are 2 possibilities for each friendship. Thus, the number of possible networks is 2 × 2 × · · · × 2, with 435 entries."

* friendship paradox:
  - sociologist Scott Feld in 1991
  - most people have fewer friends than their friends, on average.
  - consequences:
    - Popular people disproportionately set perceptions and determine norms of behavior. This can include modal man a woman dates, etc.
    - Misperceptions about popularity of some things
    - rich gets richer: people with friends more likely to get more friends.

* Friendship paradox = selection bias = doing popular things:
  - As Shane Frederick (2012) states in a study about our tendency to overestimate other people’s willingness to pay for things: “Customers in the queue at Starbucks are more visible than those hidden away in their offices unwilling to spend $4 on coffee.”

  - "We disproportionately fly on the most heavily booked flights, eat at the most popular restaurants, drive on the busiest roads and at the busiest times, go to parks and attractions at the most crowded times, and attend the most crowded concerts and movies. These experiences bias our perceptions as well as our perceived social norms"

### Networks 101

* degree = how many connections or links (relationships) that a person has in some network
* degree centrality = If someone has 200 friends and someone else has 100 friends, then the first person is twice as central according to degree centrality.
* eigenvalue centrality = person's centrality is proportional to their friend's centrality. extends degree centrality.
* betweenness/brokerage centrality = For each node in the network, betweenness centrality keeps track of the fraction of shortest paths between all other pairs of nodes that pass through that node.
* diffusion centrality = how far will information about X spread if A is the first person to heard the info.

### Applications

* Microfinance:
  * Comparing a village whose initial seeds were at the bottom end of the eigenvector centrality to one whose initial seeds were at the top of the scale led to a tripling of the participation in microfinance, on average.

  * Our estimate for the spread of microfinance was that news tended to spread for roughly three iterations—not really traveling much beyond the friends-of-friends-of-friends.

  * Also, some topics inspire people to talk with everyone they know about it, and other topics inspire people less. In the case of microfinance, our estimate of the frequency with which one household would tell one of its friends at each iteration was 1/5.

* Medici:
  * they have more connections than any other family, almost double the number of marriage and business connections of either of their connections
  * out of a fuller data set of ninety-two elite families, more than half of the families married to the Medici were married to at most two other families, while more than half of the families married to the families opposing the Medici were married to more than four other families.
  * For instance, just over half of the shortest paths between other pairs of families in the marriage network pass through the Medici, while the Strozzi lie on roughly one in ten. 1 in 10 for Albizzi. Second highest betweenness centrality for guadagni --- 1/4
