## Phishing For Phools

Thesis: "Insofar as we have any weakness in knowing what we really want, and also insofar as such a weakness can be profitably generated and primed, markets will seize the opportunity to take us in on those weaknesses."

Phishing: "It is about getting people to do things that are in the interest of the phisherman, but not in the interest of the target."

Phool is "someone who, for whatever reason, is successfully phished." "There are two kinds of phool: psychological and informational. Psychological phools, in turn, come in two types. In one case, the emotions of a psychological phool override the dictates of his common sense. In the other case, cognitive biases, which are like optical illusions, lead him to misinterpret reality, and he acts on the basis of that misinterpretation."
    - "Information phools act on information that is intentionally crafted to mislead them."

Four broad areas indicate how widespread are the NO-ONE-COULD-POSSIBLY-WANTs, regarding personal financial security; the stability of the macroeconomy (the economy as a whole); our health; and the quality of government.

### Banking

1. Ratings agencies started charging $ from investment banks for rating in 1970s. Pressure to give good ratings to customers otherwise no business.

2. High ratings of mortgage backed securities caused people to get larger mortgages.

3. One ratings agency alone, Moody’s, gave 45,000 mortgage-related securities triple-A rating (for the period 2000 to 2007)

### Phishing Strategies

1. "the makers of cake mixes appealed to housewives’ desire for creativity by unnecessarily requiring the addition of an egg."

2. Cialdini: "we are phishable because we want to reciprocate gifts and favors; because we want to be nice to people we like; because we do not want to disobey authority; because we tend to follow others in deciding how to behave; because we want our decisions to be internally consistent; and because we are averse to taking losses."

3. "...the eggs and the milk are strategically in the back of the supermarket; they are the most common purchase; and, figuratively, you have to go through the whole store to get them, being reminded of the other needs ...And when you get back to the checkout counter—waiting there—it is no coincidence that the candy and the magazines are there for you (and the kids)."

4. Reputation mining: If I have a reputation of quality, I can sell you low quality for a higher price.
    - application = ratings agencies and fin. crash
    - carl shapiro/1982/it would lead to low-quality products being ubiqutous in a free market
        + post-discovery adjustment
        + "When we listen to a news program (read the newspaper, etc.), we tend to take for granted that we are hearing (reading) the “news”: whatever that might be. Someplace in the back of our minds we have the notion that editors have culled the stories that best represent “the news” according to the “real” interests of their viewers. They are acting as our “news fiduciaries.”
    
5. Complicated

6. Trade on reputation

7. Mine motivated scrutiny: during fin. heyday, people were loathe to question the goose laying the golden egg. Great example of nonsense analysis by Cassano.

8. Develop disciplines devoted to specializing in unethical stuff with framing of ethics---due process, customer success: "Just as lawyers are supposed to defend their clients, even if guilty, advertisers are supposed to enhance the sales of the companies that hire them, even if those sales reduce customers’ well-being."

9. "Reason why" advertising: 
    - Tell people why they ought to buy X even if reasons are vacuous (you are doing obvious things done by everyone but good. For selling beer, explain it is produced in sterile conditions, uses "careful[ly chosen] ... ingredients", ..., "contains the pain reliever most recommended by doctors", etc.), misleading, or appeal to their first order pref.

10. Make a misleading +ve claim:
    - "One of its soaps, at the time with lagging sales, was a combination of palm oil and olive oil: Palmolive." ---> branded as beauty soap  
    - “At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock."

11. Associate +ve things:
    - good looking people
    - well behaved children
    - images of farm, etc.

12. Learn from data on what works:
    "But Palmolive also got another, subtler dividend from the coupons. By affixing coupons to their advertisements, Lasker and Hopkins could tell which ads worked; which ones didn’t. Just count the coupons that were returned."


### Fun Quotes

1. The fact that people don't always make decisions that are best for themselves "... is so basic that it is critical to the first story of the Bible, where the serpent beguiles innocent Eve to make ..."

2. Enron: "The “mark-to-market” accounting, whereby future expected profits from an investment could be booked when the investment was made. The more usual practice is to wait until the profits are actually realized." 

"From 1995 to 2000 Fortune named Enron the country's most innovative company."

"Fortune was right; its editors just failed to understand the nature of the innovations."

3. Keynes' predictions: "The workweek would fall to fifteen hours. Men and women alike, Keynes said, would “experience … a nervous breakdown of the sort which is already common in England and the United States amongst the wives of the well-to-do classes, unfortunate women, many of them, who have been deprived by their wealth of their traditional tasks and occupations—who cannot find it sufficiently amusing, when deprived of the spur of economic necessity, to cook and clean and mend, yet are quite unable to find anything more amusing."

and 

"We are five and a half times richer than we were back in 1930."..."Free market... also invented new 'neeeds'"

### Phool Facts

1. [From DellaVigna and Malmendier](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~sdellavi/wp/gymempAER.pdf)--- Gyms: "80 percent ... would [pay] less by the visit [than a monthly subscription]. Furthermore, the losses from this wrong choice were significant: $600 per year, out of average payments of $1,400." 

"Additionally, to add insult to injury, the health clubs put roadblocks in the way of cancellation. Of the 83 clubs offering automatic monthly renewal in the DellaVigna-Malmendier sample, all accepted cancellation by personal appearance; but only 7 would accept cancellation by phone. Only 54 would accept a letter; and, of these, 25 required it to be notarized."

2. "[In Nevada,] the average adult spends 4 percent of income on gambling, nine times the US national average."

3. "In some 30 percent of home sales to new buyers, total—buyer plus seller—transaction costs, remarkably, are more than half of the down payment that the buyer puts into the deal."

4. "In its five-year career, from 1999 to 2004, Vioxx is estimated to have caused 26,000 to 56,000 cardiovascular deaths in the United States"

5. "failure to notify women of suspicions about hormone replacement therapy, by doctors and Pharma, is estimated to have caused some 94,000 cases of breast cancer."

6. Survey: Can you come up with $2k if an unexpected need arose in the next month? "Almost 50 percent of their respondents, in the United States, replied either that they could not, or they probably could not come up with the needed $2,000." (Lusardi, Schneider, Tufano) 

and 

"in 2010 the median US working-age family held less than one month’s income in cash, or in checking, savings, or money-market accounts; in addition, but not surprisingly, the median direct holdings of stocks"

and

"Some 30 percent of households say they have resorted to super-high-interest “alternative forms of borrowing” at least once over the past five years"

and 

"In 2009 a full 2.5 percent of householders reported they had gone bankrupt in the past two years (most of which had been pre-Crash)."

and 

"Matthew Desmond revealed similarly high statistics; the annual eviction rate from 2003 to 2007—a period totally before the financial crash—was 2.7 percent."

### Addiction

1. "Ten years ago deaths due to cardiac arrest were an especially serious problem in the casinos. The emergency crews could not get through. Finally, the casinos created their own specially trained defibrillation teams. One surveillance video shows why such special training was necessary. In the video, as a squad from the casino defibrillates the heart arrest of a fellow player, the surrounding players play on, their trance unperturbed, even though the victim is literally at their feet."

### Misc.

1. Holders of large liquid assets keep money overnight at investment banks than comm. banks because investment banks insured w/ collateral. FDIC insurance only works for $100k.
